# Tuple Splitting
There has been a host of work on entity resolution (ER), to identify tuples that refer to the same entity. This paper studies the inverse of ER, to identify tuples to which distinct real-world entities are matched by mistake, and split such tuples into a set of tuples, one for each entity. We formulate the tuple splitting problem. We propose a scheme to decide what tuples to split and what tuples to correct without splitting, fix errors/assign attribute values to the split tuples, and impute missing values. The scheme introduces a class of rules, which embed predicates for aligning entities across relations and knowledge graphs ùê∫ , assessing correlation between attributes, and extracting data from ùê∫. It unifies logic deduction, correlation models, and data extraction by chasing the data with the rules. We train machine learning models to assess attribute correlation and predict missing values. We develop algorithms for the tuple splitting scheme.

## Install Required Packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prepare Datasets
The datasets, dicts, Mc model and Md model used in this project can be downloaded from [This Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Bc20q3hc26cqW-7zJ3R0xHm-t00CrIu?usp=sharing). 
Before running codes, you need to put them in the following directory:
```
mkdir -p /tmp/tuple_splitting/
mv datasets /tmp/tuple_splitting/
mv dict_model /tmp/tuple_splitting/
```

## How To Run
To reproduce the experimental results in the paper, you may run all `exp_*.sh` scripts in `shell/`, such as:
```
cd shell/
./exp_college_overall.sh
```
The results will be output to `/tmp/tuple_splitting/results/`

### Instructions
- `shell/exp_*_overall.sh` are for evaluating overall accuracy (DS, AA and MI), where each phase is based on the output results of the previous phase.  
- `shell/exp_*_separate.sh` are for evaluating separate accuracy (DS, AA and MI), where each phase is based on the groundtruth of the previous phase.  
- `shell/exp_*_time.sh` are for evaluating running time.

### Explanations for buttons in scripts
